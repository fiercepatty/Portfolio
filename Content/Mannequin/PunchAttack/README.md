# UE4-Cpp-AI-Series-Melee-Attack-Files
Files for Part 7 to 9 of my UE4 C++ AI Youtube Series.

Y Bot Right Hook.fbx - Mixamo Y-bot that contains a right hook animation.
Mixamo Bone Mappings.pdf - lists corresponding Mixamo and UE4 mannequin bone names.
MixamoBoneMapping.uasset - a UE4 bone mapping asset to be used for re-targeting the Right Hook animation to the UE4 Mannequin.
RightHook_Anim.uasset - The finished remapped animation.

To use, drag the fbx and uasset files into a folder in your Unreal Engine project. Unreal will split the fbx into its mesh, skeleton, animation and materials etc.
